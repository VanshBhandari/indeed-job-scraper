### indeed-job-scraper
#### Overview
This program scrapes the [indeed website](https://ca.indeed.com) and returns valid job openings.
#### How it works
The user enters a keyword and location and the program searches Indeed for valid job openings. It returns job openings from pages equivalent to user's input and asks the user to either save or not save. The saved jobs are stored in a text file.
###### Why would you use it over the indeed website? I don't know but it's cool!
